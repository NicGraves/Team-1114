# Team1114
This is a project that creates a working text editor that is able to compile and run code. Multiple different projects can be saved and each project can have multiple files.

Create new project:
Project -> Create New Project -> Enter Project Name

Close project:
Project -> Close Project

Open project:
Project -> Open Project -> Select in file chooser

Note: creating a project automatically saves it to the text editors designated workspace, so there is no need for a save project button. Create new project is a combination of create and save to streamline user experience. Only a save file button is needed, which will be included in the next iteration.

File -> Create New File -> Type in file name 
Must be in a project directory.

Save file:
File -> Save
Must have file open to save.

Open file:
File -> Open -> Type in file name
Opens file in current directory.

Close file:
File -> Close
Closes current file.

Remove file:
File -> Remove -> Type in file name
Deletes current file from system.
